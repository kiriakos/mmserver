/*

 This is a sample configuration file for mmserver. On startup, mmserver
 searches for a configuration file in the following sequence:
 
 1. ~/.mmserver/mmserver.conf
    (This is the recommended installation location.)
 2. /usr/share/mmserver/mmserver.conf
    (If location 1 is not found but location 2 is found, mmserver will first 
    attempt to install the configuration file from location 2 to location 1.)
 3. internal defaults

 If mmserver is invoked with the path to a specific configuration file as the
 first argument, the above search sequence is ignored and only the
 user-specified configuration file is considered.
